# Particle-Swarm-Optimisation
This repo contains simulation of particle swarm optimisation algorithms in dynamic and static environments with dynamic network topology
The simulations are done using Python matplotlib.
The performance of the algorithm is measured in terms of velocity correlation between the particles.The code for evaluating this is also included here.

The hardware implementation and simulation videos can be found here.
